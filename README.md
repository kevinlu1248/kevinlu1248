<!-- # Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin! -->

## :book: About Me
- ðŸ§¹ Building [Sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep), an AI powered junior dev
- :link: Find my info at https://kevin-lu.tech
- :bust_in_silhouette: Pronouns: He/Him

## ðŸ”­ I previously worked on ...
- [Aline](https://github.com/aline-ai/): a tool to reshape research
- :closed_book: [PyATE](https://pypi.org/project/pyate/): Python Automated Term Extraction, a Python package that implements five automated term extraction (ATE) algorithms based on eight research papers, attaining over 20,000 downloads!
- :recycle: [Recycler](https://github.com/kevinlu1248/recycler): Fine-tuned model of Google's XCeption that uses image recognition to classify images of recyclables by materials, such as glass or metal, reaching 86% accuracy, using Gary Thung's dataset
- :pencil2: [Research Mode](https://kevin-lu.tech/researchy-chrome-extension/): Chrome Extension that provides a convenient sidebar for note-taking as well as other NLP-based utilities for accelerating research, such as automated jargon highlighting, text simplification and reader mode. Future features include auto-generated citations, semantic search and automated summarization.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Locally running LLMs for code generation (CodeGen-2.5-mono + ONNX maybe?)
- Training and evaluating better natural language code search embedding models
- Interested in fine-tuning models to act as agents who can use tools. Maybe reinforcement learning on successful/unsuccessful HotPotQA runs?
- Using language models to do static asset manipulation, such as generating my favicons for my site
- Gallian's _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_
- Stein and Shakarchi's _Princeton Lectures in Analysis II: Complex Analysis_

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- Evaluating and fine-tuning [GTE](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-base) on natural language to code search. It's amazing at most things but not evaluated on code search.

## :confetti_ball: Fun fact
:trumpet: I'm a trumpet player and have done some research on the physics of trumpets. I also made a Google assistance app for drone tuning. I have played in pop orchestras, marching bands, and jazz ensembles, of which my favourite is jazz ensembles.

## Credits
- [Raymond Li](https://github.com/Raymo111/) for his [intro gif](https://codesandbox.io/s/readme-introgif-9fjo5); I forked [it](https://codesandbox.io/s/readme-introgif-forked-5fdx7) for my own needs
- [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7) for her open-sourced [personal website](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4); I used it as a Gatsby template to create my own personal website
