<!-- # Hi there 👋, I'm Kevin! -->

## :book: About Me
- 🧹 Building [Sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep), an AI powered junior dev
- :link: Find my info at https://kevin-lu.tech

## 🔭 I previously worked on ...
- 🏃‍♂️ At Roblox, forking [RigNet](https://github.com/zhan-xu/RigNet): a graph-based convolution network used to generate rig and skinning data for animating avatars.
- :pencil: [Aline](https://github.com/aline-ai/): a tool to reshape research with context-aware auto-generation
- :closed_book: [PyATE](https://pypi.org/project/pyate/): Python Automated Term Extraction, a Python package that implements five automated term extraction (ATE) algorithms based on eight research papers, attaining over 20,000 downloads!

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Traversing the call graph in a repo to make the LLM make better changes
- Locally running LLMs for code generation (CodeGen-2.5-mono + ONNX maybe?)
- Training and evaluating better natural language code search embedding models
- Interested in fine-tuning models to act as agents who can use tools. Maybe reinforcement learning on successful/unsuccessful HotPotQA runs?
- Using language models to do static asset manipulation, such as generating my favicons for my site
- Gallian's _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_
- Stein and Shakarchi's _Princeton Lectures in Analysis II: Complex Analysis_

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- Evaluating and fine-tuning [GTE](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-base) and [BGE](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) on natural language to code search, such as CodeSearchNet. It's amazing at most things but not evaluated on code search.
- Setting up an LSP on the server to set up call graphs to track the source of function calls so that Sweep can traverse this when editing entities.

## :confetti_ball: Fun fact
:trumpet: I'm a trumpet player and have done some research on the physics of trumpets. I also made a Google assistance app for drone tuning. I have played in pop orchestras, marching bands, and jazz ensembles, of which my favourite is jazz ensembles.
